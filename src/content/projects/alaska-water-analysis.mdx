## Description

This repository contains the code, dataset access instructions, and analysis for the research project:

"Analysis of Hydrochemical Variability in Southcentral Alaska Using Clustering Techniques and GIS"

The study applies clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN) and geospatial analysis (GIS, Kriging interpolation, Folium mapping) to investigate hydrochemical variability across Southcentral Alaska. It identifies distinct geochemical zones and contamination hotspots that can inform water resource management and environmental decision-making.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

- **Dataset:** Hydrochemical and geospatial data from Southcentral Alaska (HydroShare).  
- **Clustering Techniques:**  
  - **K-Means** â†’ 5 distinct geochemical clusters  
  - **DBSCAN** â†’ 2 dense clusters + anomalies (possible contamination hotspots)  
- **Spatial Analysis:**  
  - Kriging interpolation for unsampled regions  
  - Folium maps for interactive visualization  
- **Goal:** Combine clustering with GIS to reveal geochemical zones and contamination hotspots.
